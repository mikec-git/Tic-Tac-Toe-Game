This Tic Tac Toe game project is a means to practice the incorporation of several programming techniques and features.
This includes the use of enumerators, classes, methods, scope, and many more concepts. 

At the same time, I will be using this project as a means to learn how to use Git and GitHub.
This text file will be a test file for practicing the different techniques of making a repo.

- I have now tried adding a branch under branch1
