This Tic Tac Toe game project is a means to practice the incorporation of several programming techniques and features.
This includes the use of enumerators, classes, methods, scope, and many more concepts. 

At the same time, I will be using this project as a means to learn how to use Git and GitHub.

- I have now tried adding a branch under branch1
- I have now made edits to a branch AND the master and merged
